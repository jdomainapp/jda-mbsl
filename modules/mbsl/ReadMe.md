- This is the current release version
=======
***Version: 1.1-clean-initial***
- This version has been cleaned from `v1.0-bak` to streamline the Maven's module configuration and to remove all the unnecessary artifacts and resources.
- `jda-mbsl` has been retested to ensure that it still works as before
- The source code has not been changed in anyway. 
- This version is thus used as the starting point for any further development.
